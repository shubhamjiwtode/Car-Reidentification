# Car-Reidentification
Deep Neural Network project for car re identification and tracking.
Vehicle re identification is one of the challenging computer vision job, the minute variation in car of same color and variation in illumination, view angle, background makes it difficult to recognize same car in different cameras. This paper provides a simple but not trivial solution to address this problem, model used in this paper consist of a pre-trained model that can detect cars, a Siamese model to detect the car of our interest in that video frame and median flow tracker method from OpenCV that tracks object (car in our case) with low computation power. This model provides an efficient way to perform the task such that GPU power is used when needed by the system. Model was successfully able to identify the vehicle and draw some useful information like speed and direction of the vehicle. Reidentifications of vehicle can be used in many areas from video surveillance, assisting drone to follow a vehicle, vehicle pursuit. The work done in this paper was limited due to computation power and good dataset. We will also cover what can be done further to improve the model efficiency and raise the accuracy.
